    <h2>An Expression of Individuality</h2>
    <p>Custom motorcycles can be anything the builder would like them to be. They are a motorcycle with structural or stylistic changes that make them unique from the mass produced bikes filling up the roadways. Motorcycles are special because they give the rider a way to express themselves well doing a mundane daily task like commuting. Custom bikes take it a step further and allow the rider to truly express their own individuality.</p>
